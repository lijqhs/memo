# SOLID principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five principles in object-oriented programming that are designed to guide the design of software that is modular, maintainable, and flexible. The SOLID principles are an acronym that stands for:

- S: Single Responsibility Principle
- O: Open/Closed Principle
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle
- I: Interface Segregation Principle
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle

Here's a brief explanation of each principle:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have only one responsibility or job, and that it should be focused on doing that job well. This principle helps to ensure that classes are modular and easy to maintain, since each class is responsible for only a single aspect of the system.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that it can be extended without needing to modify its source code. This principle helps to ensure that the existing code is not affected by changes to the system, and that the system is flexible enough to accommodate new requirements.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to be used wherever the base class is used, without any unexpected behavior. This principlehelps to ensure that objects are interchangeable and that the behavior of the system is predictable.
  - Parameter types in a method of a subclass should match or be more abstract than parameter types in the method of the superclass.
  - The return type in a method of a subclass should match or be a subtype of the return type in the method of the superclass.
  - A method in a subclass shouldn’t throw types of exceptions which the base method isn’t expected to throw.
  - A subclass shouldn’t strengthen pre-conditions.
  - A subclass shouldn’t weaken post-conditions.
  - Invariants of a superclass must be preserved.
  - A subclass shouldn’t change values of private fields of the superclass.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that interfaces should be designed in such a way that clients only need to depend on the methods they actually use. This principle helps to ensure that the code is modular and that changes to one part of the system do not affect other parts of the system unnecessarily.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that the design of the system should be such that the high-level modules are not tightly coupled to the low-level modules, and that both modules depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations. This principle helps to ensure that the system is flexible and maintainable, and that changes to one part of the system do not have a ripple effect throughout the entire system.

In summary, the SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help to ensure that software is modular, maintainable, and flexible. By following these principles, developers can create software that is easy to understand, modify, and extend over time.
