# Strategy

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. The pattern allows you to vary the behavior of an object by selecting the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

The main idea behind the Strategy pattern is to provide a way to change an object's behavior without changing its implementation. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly in the object, the Strategy pattern defines a set of algorithms as separate objects and allows the object to select the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

## Example

Here's an example of the Strategy pattern in Python:

```python
# Strategy interface
class Strategy:
    def do_algorithm(self, data):
        pass

# Concrete strategy classes
class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def do_algorithm(self, data):
        return sorted(data)

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def do_algorithm(self, data):
        return reversed(sorted(data))

# Context class
class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def do_some_business_logic(self, data):
        result = self._strategy.do_algorithm(data)
        print(result)

# Client code
def client_code():
    context = Context(ConcreteStrategyA())
    context.do_some_business_logic([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])

    context.set_strategy(ConcreteStrategyB())
    context.do_some_business_logic([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])

# Usage
client_code()
```

In this example, we have a `Strategy` interface that defines the common interface for all the concrete strategy classes. The `Strategy` object represents an algorithm that can be used to perform a particular task.

The `ConcreteStrategyA` and `ConcreteStrategyB` classes are concrete strategy classes that implement the `Strategy` interface. Each `ConcreteStrategy` object encapsulates an algorithm that can be used to perform a particular task.

The `Context` class is the object that uses the algorithm to perform a particular task. The `Context` object maintains a reference to the current `Strategy` object and delegates to it to perform the algorithm.

When we create a `Context` object, change its strategy using the `set_strategy` method, and perform a task using the `do_some_business_logic` method, we get the output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

As you can see, the `Context` object's behavior changes as its internal strategy changes. The `Context` object delegates the algorithm to the current `Strategy` object using the `do_algorithm` method. This example demonstrates how the Strategy pattern can be used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable.
