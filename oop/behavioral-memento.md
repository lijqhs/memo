# Memento

![analogy](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/memento/problem1-en.png)

The Memento pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later without violating encapsulation.

The main idea behind the Memento pattern is to provide a way to save and restore an object's state without exposing its internal structure. This allows you to save the state of an object at a particular point in time and restore it later if necessary.

## Example

Here's an example of the Memento pattern in Python:

```python
# Memento class
class Memento:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self._state = state

    def get_state(self):
        return self._state

# Originator class
class Originator:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self._state = state

    def create_memento(self):
        return Memento(self._state)

    def restore_memento(self, memento):
        self._state = memento.get_state()

    def get_state(self):
        return self._state

    def set_state(self, state):
        self._state = state

# Caretaker class
class Caretaker:
    def __init__(self, originator):
        self._originator = originator
        self._mementos = []

    def backup(self):
        self._mementos.append(self._originator.create_memento())

    def undo(self):
        if len(self._mementos) > 0:
            memento = self._mementos.pop()
            self._originator.restore_memento(memento)

# Client code
def client_code():
    originator = Originator("State 1")
    caretaker = Caretaker(originator)

    caretaker.backup()
    originator.set_state("State 2")

    caretaker.backup()
    originator.set_state("State 3")

    caretaker.undo()
    print(originator.get_state())

    caretaker.undo()
    print(originator.get_state())

# Usage
client_code()
```

In this example, we have a `Memento` class that represents the state of an object at a particular point in time. The `Memento` object encapsulates the object's internal state and provides a way to retrieve it later.

The `Originator` class is the object whose state is being saved and restored. The `Originator` object creates a `Memento` object to save its current state and restores its state from a `Memento` object.

The `Caretaker` class is responsible for managing the `Memento` objects. It stores the `Memento` objects in a list and provides methods for saving and restoring the `Originator` object's state.

When we create an `Originator` object, a `Caretaker` object, save the `Originator`'s state using the `backup` method, change the `Originator`'s state, and restore the `Originator`'s state using the `undo` method, we get the output:

```
State 2
State 1
```

As you can see, the `Caretaker` object manages the `Memento` objects and allows the `Originator` object's state to be saved and restored without exposing its internal structure. This example demonstrates how the Memento pattern can be used to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later without violating encapsulation.

## Relations with Other Patterns

- You can use Command and Memento together when implementing “undo”. In this case, commands are responsible for performing various operations over a target object, while mementos save the state of that object just before a command gets executed.

- You can use Memento along with Iterator to capture the current iteration state and roll it back if necessary.

- Sometimes Prototype can be a simpler alternative to Memento. This works if the object, the state of which you want to store in the history, is fairly straightforward and doesn’t have links to external resources, or the links are easy to re-establish.
