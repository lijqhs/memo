# Iterator

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

The main idea behind the Iterator pattern is to provide a uniform interface for traversing different types of collections, such as arrays, lists, trees, and so on. This interface allows clients to iterate over the elements of a collection without having to know about the internal structure of the collection.

## Example

Here's an example of the Iterator pattern in Python:

```python
# Iterator interface
class Iterator:
    def __init__(self, collection):
        self._collection = collection
        self._index = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self._index < len(self._collection):
            value = self._collection[self._index]
            self._index += 1
            return value
        else:
            raise StopIteration

# Aggregate interface
class Aggregate:
    def create_iterator(self):
        pass

# Concrete aggregate class
class ListAggregate(Aggregate):
    def __init__(self):
        self._list = []

    def add(self, value):
        self._list.append(value)

    def create_iterator(self):
        return Iterator(self._list)

# Client code
def client_code(iterator: Iterator):
    while True:
        try:
            value = next(iterator)
            print(value)
        except StopIteration:
            break

# Usage
list_aggregate = ListAggregate()
list_aggregate.add("Item 1")
list_aggregate.add("Item 2")
list_aggregate.add("Item 3")
iterator = list_aggregate.create_iterator()
client_code(iterator)
```

In this example, we have an `Iterator` interface that defines the common interface for all the concrete iterator classes. The `Iterator` object represents an iterator that can traverse the elements of a collection.

The `Aggregate` interface defines the common interface for all the concrete aggregate classes. The `Aggregate` object represents the collection that can be iterated over.

The `ListAggregate` class is a concrete aggregate class that implements the `Aggregate` interface. The `ListAggregate` class represents a list that can be iterated over.

When we create a `ListAggregate` object, add some items to it, create an iterator using the `create_iterator` method, and pass the iterator to the `client_code` function, we get the output:

```
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
```

As you can see, the `client_code` function iterates over the elements of the list using the `next` method of the iterator. The iterator provides a uniform interface for traversing the list without exposing its underlying representation. This example demonstrates how the Iterator pattern can be used to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Relations with Other Patterns

- You can use Iterators to traverse Composite trees.

- You can use Factory Method along with Iterator to let collection subclasses return different types of iterators that are compatible with the collections.

- You can use Memento along with Iterator to capture the current iteration state and roll it back if necessary.

- You can use Visitor along with Iterator to traverse a complex data structure and execute some operation over its elements, even if they all have different classes.
