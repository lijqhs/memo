Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. While inheritance can be a powerful tool, there are also some drawbacks that need to be considered:

1. Tight Coupling: Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the superclass and subclass, meaning changes made to the superclass can affect the subclass, and vice versa. This can make the code difficult to maintain and can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. Fragile Base Class Problem: If the superclass is modified, it can potentially break all the subclasses that rely on it. This can make the codebase fragile and difficult to maintain.

3. Inflexibility: Inheritance can limit the flexibility of the code and make it difficult to change the behavior of a class. This is because the behavior of a subclass is largely determined by the superclass it inherits from.

4. Hierarchical Complexity: Inheritance can lead to hierarchical complexity, where the relationships between classes become difficult to understand and manage as the number of classes increases.

Here are some ways to deal with these drawbacks:

1. Favor composition over inheritance: Consider using composition instead of inheritance. Composition allows you to build complex objects from simpler ones by combining them. This can help to reduce the tight coupling between classes and make the code more flexible.

2. Use interfaces: Interfaces provide a way to define a set of methods that a class must implement. This can help to reduce the fragility of the code by allowing classes to change their implementation without affecting other classes.

3. Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow: Try to keep inheritance hierarchies shallow to avoid hierarchical complexity. If the hierarchy becomes too deep, it can become difficult to understand and manage.

4. Use abstract classes: Abstract classes provide a way to define a common interface for a set of subclasses. This can help to reduce the inflexibility of inheritance by allowing subclasses to override some methods while inheriting others.

5. Use unit testing: Use unit testing to ensure that changes to the superclass do not break the subclasses. Unit testing can help to identify problems early and ensure that the codebase remains stable and maintainable.
