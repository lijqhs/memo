## Design Patterns

- Creational patterns
  - [Factory Method](creational-factory-method.md): creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
  - [Abstract Factory](creational-abstract-factory.md): groups object factories that have a common theme.
  - Builder: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
  - [Prototype](prototype.md): creates objects by cloning an existing object.
  - Singleton: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
