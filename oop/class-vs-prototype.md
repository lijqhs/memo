# Class-based programming vs prototype-based programming

[Class-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming) and [prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) are two different paradigms for object-oriented programming (OOP).

Class-based programming is the more traditional approach to OOP, where classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects. A class is a blueprint or template for objects, which defines the properties and methods that objects of that class will have. Objects are instances of a class, and multiple objects of the same class can be created. In class-based programming, objects inherit properties and methods from their class, and objects of different classes cannot be combined or merged.

Prototype-based programming, on the other hand, is an alternative approach to OOP where objects are created by cloning existing objects, called prototypes. A prototype is a fully-formed object that serves as a template for creating new objects. When a new object is created, it inherits properties and methods from its prototype, and any changes made to the prototype are automatically reflected in all objects that inherit from it. In prototype-based programming, objects are not defined by classes, but rather by their prototypes, and objects can be dynamically modified and combined.

To illustrate the differences between class-based and prototype-based programming, let's consider a simple example of creating a person object:

Class-based programming:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person("John", 30)
person2 = Person("Jane", 25)
```

In this example, we define a class called "Person" with properties "name" and "age". We then create two instances of the "Person" class, which are two separate objects with their own unique properties.

Prototype-based programming:

```python
person_prototype = {
    "name": "",
    "age": 0
}

person1 = person_prototype.copy()
person1["name"] = "John"
person1["age"] = 30

person2 = person_prototype.copy()
person2["name"] = "Jane"
person2["age"] = 25
```

In this example, we define a prototype for a person object, which is a dictionary with properties "name" and "age". We then create two instances of the person object by copying the prototype and modifying its properties. Because both objects inherit from the same prototype, any changes made to the prototype will be reflected in both objects.

Overall, class-based programming and prototype-based programming each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and are suited for different types of applications. Class-based programming is more structured and predictable, while prototype-based programming is more flexible and dynamic.
