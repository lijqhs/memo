# Duck Typing

Duck typing is a concept in dynamic programming languages like Python, where the type of an object is determined not by its class name, but by its behavior or the methods and attributes it defines. The term "duck typing" comes from the phrase "if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

In Python, duck typing means that an object's suitability for a given task is determined by the presence of specific methods or attributes, rather than its type. For example, if an object has a `get()` method, we can treat it as a dictionary, even if it's not actually an instance of the `dict` class.

Here's an example of duck typing in Python:

```python
def print_area(shape):
    print(shape.area())

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

rectangle = Rectangle(2, 4)
circle = Circle(3)

print_area(rectangle) # prints 8
print_area(circle) # prints 28.26
```

In this example, we define two classes, `Rectangle` and `Circle`, that both have an `area()` method. We then define a function `print_area()` that takes an object as an argument and calls its `area()` method.

By passing a `Rectangle` object and a `Circle` object to `print_area()`, we can see that duck typing is at work - the function works with both objects even though they are of different types, because they both implement the necessary `area()` method.

Duck typing can be a powerful tool for writing flexible and extensible code, as it allows you to work with objects based on their behavior rather than their type. However, it requires careful design and testing to ensure that your code works as intended with different types of objects.

## Those not using duck typing

There are programming languages that don't support duck typing. Duck typing is a feature of dynamically typed languages, where the type of an object is determined at runtime based on its behavior. In contrast, statically typed languages require explicit type declarations and do not support the same kind of dynamic type inference that duck typing relies on.

Some examples of statically typed languages that do not support duck typing include Java, C++, and C#. In these languages, the type of an object must be explicitly declared and defined at compile-time, and objects of different types cannot be treated as if they were of the same type at runtime.

However, it's worth noting that some statically typed languages have features that allow for some degree of dynamic typing or type inference. For example, Java has the Object class, which can be used as a catch-all type for any object, and C# has the var keyword, which allows for type inference in certain situations.

Overall, while duck typing is a feature of many dynamically typed languages, it is not a universal feature of all programming languages and is not always appropriate or necessary for all types of programming tasks.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism and duck typing are related concepts in object-oriented programming, but they are not the same thing.

**Polymorphism** refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. Polymorphism allows you to write code that works with different types of objects, without needing to know the specific type of each object at runtime. Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance, interfaces, or other mechanisms that allow objects to share common behaviors and interfaces.

```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

shapes = [Rectangle(2, 4), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.area())
```

**Duck typing** is a form of polymorphism that relies on an object's behavior or the methods and attributes it defines, rather than its type or class. In duck typing, an object's suitability for a given task is determined by the presence of specific methods or attributes, rather than its type. If an object has the necessary methods or attributes, it can be used in a given context, even if it's not an instance of a particular class.

While duck typing is a form of polymorphism, not all forms of polymorphism rely on duck typing. For example, inheritance-based polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class, based on their inheritance hierarchy and shared behaviors. Similarly, interface-based polymorphism allows objects to share a common interface, even if they have different implementations.

Overall, both polymorphism and duck typing are important concepts in object-oriented programming, but they differ in their implementation and the mechanisms they use to achieve flexibility and extensibility in code.
